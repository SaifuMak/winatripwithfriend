        <li>
          If a prize is provided to the Promoter by a third party, the prize is
          subject to the terms and conditions of the third party prize supplier.
          The terms and conditions which apply to the prize at the time it is
          issued to the winner will prevail over these Terms and Conditions in
          the event of any inconsistency. To the extent permitted by law the
          Promoter accepts no responsibility or liability for any delay or
          failure by the third party to deliver the prize, any delay or failure
          relating to the prize itself or failure by the third party to meet any
          of its obligations in these Terms and Conditions or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any guarantee or warranty given is in addition to any relevant
          statutory guarantees and warranties and nothing in these Terms and
          Conditions restricts, excludes or modifies or purports to restrict,
          exclude or modify any statutory consumer rights under any applicable
          law including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).
        </li>
        <li>
          If for any reason any aspect of this Promotion is not capable of
          running as planned, including by reason of computer virus,
          communications network failure, bugs, tampering, unauthorised
          intervention, fraud, technical failure or any cause beyond the control
          of the Promoter, the Promoter may in its sole discretion cancel,
          terminate, modify or suspend the Promotion and invalidate any affected
          entries, or suspend or modify a prize, subject to relevant State
          regulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the extent that a situation, malfunction, or other issue arises for
          which these Terms and Conditions make no provision or in relation to
          which the relevant terms and conditions are unclear, the Promoter
          reserves the right to:
          <br />
          (a) make a decision regarding those circumstances which is not
          inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions; and/or
          <br />
          (b) postpone any determination of a prize winner to a time and place
          which will allow the determination to be conducted in accordance with
          all Terms and Conditions other than those Terms and Conditions which
          specify the time and/or place of the determination of a prize winner.
        </li>
        <li>
          The prize will be awarded to the person named in the entry and any
          entry that is made on behalf of an entrant or by a third party will be
          invalid. The Promoter reserves the right, at any time, to validate and
          check the authenticity of entries and entrant's details (including an
          entrant's identity, age and place of residence). In the event that a
          winner cannot provide suitable proof as required by the Promoter to
          validate their entry, the winner will forfeit the prize in whole and
          no substitute will be offered. If there is a dispute as to the
          identity of an entrant or winner, the Promoter reserves the right, in
          its sole discretion, to determine the identity of the entrant or
          winner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incomplete, indecipherable, inaudible, incorrect and illegible
          entries, as applicable, will at the Promoter's discretion be deemed
          invalid and not eligible to win. Entries containing offensive or
          defamatory comments, or which breach any law or infringe any third
          party rights, including intellectual property rights, are not eligible
          to win. The use of any automated entry software or any other
          mechanical or electronic means that allows an individual to
          automatically enter repeatedly is prohibited and may render all
          entries submitted by that individual invalid. The Promoter reserves
          the right to disqualify entries in the event of non-compliance with
          these Terms and Conditions. If there is a dispute concerning the
          conduct of the Promotion or claiming a prize, the Promoter will
          resolve the dispute in direct consultation with the entrant. If the
          dispute cannot be resolved the Promoter’s decision, acting reasonably,
          will be final.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Promoter will not be liable for any loss (including, without
          limitation, indirect, special or consequential loss or loss of
          profits), expense, damage, personal injury or death which is suffered
          or sustained (whether or not arising from any person's negligence or
          wilful misconduct) in connection with this Promotion or accepting or
          using any prize (or recommendation), except for any liability which
          under statute cannot be excluded (in which case that liability is
          limited to the greatest extent allowed by law).
        </li>
        <li>
          Without limiting the preceding paragraph, the Promoter is not liable
          for: (a) any loss, expense, or damage that arises due to any delays
          in, or cancellations to, flights or accommodation to the extent those
          things are due to factors outside the Promoter's reasonable control;
          and (b) any loss of, damage to or delay in delivery of prizes or any
          damage that occurs to prizes if/when displayed at the Promoter’s
          premises to the extent those things are due to factors outside the
          Promoter's reasonable control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless otherwise specified, a prize is a single event for the winner
          (and where relevant their companion) and cannot be separated into
          individual events or components.
        </li>
        <li>
          The winner will participate in and co-operate as required with all
          reasonable marketing and editorial activities relating to the
          Promotion, including (but not limited to) being recorded,
          photographed, filmed or interviewed and acknowledges that the
          Promoter may use any such marketing and editorial material without
          further reference or compensation to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Promoter accepts no responsibility for any tax implications and
          the entrant must seek their own independent financial advice in
          regards to the tax implications relating to the prize or acceptance of
          the prize.
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure by the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does
          not constitute a waiver of these rights.
        </li>
        <li>The laws of the state of Queensland govern the Promotion.</li>
